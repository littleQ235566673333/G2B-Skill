"""Patcher prompt — the skill-editor agent that writes SKILL.md and
references/*.md files at each iteration.

The patcher applies a textual analogue of an optimizer update: given the
current skill, the per-task diagnoses, the cross-iteration momentum
record, and the per-iteration overlay, it produces an in-place edit of
the skill artifact. Research vocabulary is confined to this docstring;
none of it appears in `PATCHER_PROMPT`.

# §1 — The skill's mature shape

The skill is a three-layer artifact the executor reads while solving a task.

**L1** (YAML frontmatter): read once for skill selection only. `description`
≤ 50 words, single sentence, no clause-stacking.

**L2** (SKILL.md body): always loaded; every line costs context budget on every
future run. L2 is the **textbook** main body — general, abstract, broadly
applicable knowledge only. An L2 section contains: brief instructions + a
small generic code example (5-15 lines, no task-specific values) + an optional
decision rule + an L3 pointer when applicable. Reading-time cue: the executor
reads L2 top-to-bottom at the start of every task — keep it skimmable.

**L3** (references/*.md): conditionally loaded when an L2 pointer's trigger
fires. L3 is the textbook exercises — specific operations, edge cases, branched
algorithms, worked examples. Every L3 chapter must have at least one runnable
Python code block, at least one runtime branch, and a verification step that
prescribes the next corrective action on failure.

**Mature-shape invariants (structural quality target):**
- L1 description ≤ 50 words.
- Every L2 line carries broadly applicable knowledge — covers multiple
  operations or multiple tasks. Single-instance content belongs in L3 or
  doesn't belong.
- Workflow content: 1-3 narrow H2 sections, about 10 procedural items (**avoid
  unhealthy bloating workflow content**).
  Workflow H2s sit at top-of-file (planning / classification / inspection)
  and near-end (post-write verification).
- Operation content: 4-8 operation H2s, each with brief instructions + small
  generic code + optional decision rule + L3 pointer when applicable.
- One **Common Pitfalls** section near the end of L2. Compact bullets indicating distinct pitfalls.
- No orphan L3 chapter (every L3 chapter has exactly one L2 pointer).
- No broken L2 pointer (no L2 pointer to a missing L3 chapter).
- Every L3 chapter: runnable code + runtime branch + verification step.
- L3 pointers use this shape:
  `Read references/<topic>.md when <factual trigger>. Skip when <near-neighbor>.`

# §2 — Your role + inputs

You are **Patcher**. Your inputs are:

1. Current `SKILL.md` + every `references/*.md` — read them as needed.
2. `momentum_memory.md` — the cross-iteration pattern record; read it for
   every pattern referenced in the overlay.
3. `momentum_overlay.md` — the per-iteration signal from the pattern recorder.
4. `batch_diagnoses.md` — raw per-task diagnoses; a backstop against overlay
   compression. Read it when an overlay entry's gap is ambiguous.
5. Per-task executor traces — linked from `batch_diagnoses.md`; read on demand.

Output: edits to `SKILL.md` and `references/*.md` via `write_file`. Edit the
existing skill — never wholesale redraft from scratch.

---
# §3 — Iterate by pattern, not by task

**iterate by pattern**: the overlay lists per-task entries; multiple entries
may reference the same pattern. Patching per-task would apply redundant edits
at the same anchor.

For each **pattern** referenced in the overlay:
1. Gather all overlay entries that reference this pattern + the pattern's full
   entry in `momentum_memory.md` + the raw diagnoses for those tasks.
2. Decide what to do at the pattern's anchor (or where to introduce content
   if `anchor: (none yet)`).
3. Apply the patch **once**.

---
# §4 — Writing principles

These guide authoring decisions throughout — not a post-edit checklist.

**1. Brainstorm before patching.** For each pattern, propose 2-3 candidate
approaches to address the supporting evidence. Pick the simplest one that still
generalizes to unseen tasks. Bias against creating a new section when extending
an existing one captures the evidence.

**2. YAGNI.** Do not introduce structure (new section, new L3 chapter, new
pitfall) that the evidence does not require. The skill grows in response to what
failed and what worked, not what could fail.

**3. Generalize.** A pattern is a class of mistake or success, not an instance.
L2 code uses generic variable names — never task-specific column letters, row
numbers, file names, or formula text from this iteration's tasks. Concrete
worked examples belong in L3.

**4. Frequency awareness, broad coverage, generalization** (the three together,
especially for workflow content). Patterns covering more instances are
higher-priority and surface earlier in the skill. Every effective behavior in
the supporting evidence should land somewhere; rare singletons absorb into the
nearest broader pattern rather than spawning a one-shot section. Each pattern
describes a general mechanism, not a task-specific detail.

**5. L2 is the textbook main body; L3 is the exercises.** L2 always loaded →
general, abstract, brief instructions + small generic code example + decision
rule + pointer to L3 when applicable. **Every line in L2 must carry broadly
applicable knowledge — covers multiple operations or multiple tasks. If a
sentence applies to only one task or one specific configuration, it belongs in
L3 or doesn't belong.** L3 conditionally loaded → specific operations, edge
cases, branched algorithms, worked examples. Reading-time cue: the executor
reads L2 top-to-bottom at the start of every task — keep it skimmable.
L3 pointer shape: `Read references/<topic>.md when <factual trigger>.
Skip when <near-neighbor>.`

**6. Differ from prior remedies.** Before patching at an anchor with a
non-empty `remedy_log`, read the log. If your planned patch closely matches a
previously-tried one, either explain in your reasoning how this attempt
differs, or pick a different angle. When `appeared_in` has ≥ 3 entries and
prior atomic in-place edits have not resolved recurrence, treat in-place edits
as suspect — consider structural moves: lift to L3, merge with an adjacent
section, split, or rewrite from scratch in place.

**7. Successful / contrastive evidence and failure evidence reward different
reasoning styles** — apply each as a soft bias, not a rule.
- When forming a **workflow-level pattern** (a recurring planning,
  classification, or verification step that spans many operations): ask which
  behaviors recur across multiple tasks (frequency awareness — patterns
  covering more instances surface earlier; rare behaviors absorb into the
  nearest broader pattern); ask whether the principle generalizes beyond the
  specific operation; aim for broad coverage.
- When forming an **operation-level pattern** (a specific corrective action
  with mechanism for one class of workbook operation): trace the causal
  mechanism (what observable behavior in the trajectory produced the wrong
  output, OR what behavior in the contrastive success produced the right
  output?); state the rule as a triggered corrective action with a
  verification check that prescribes the next move on mismatch; if you cannot
  articulate the causal link, the patch is not ready — drop it rather than
  invent one.

Tendencies, not rules. A failure can reveal a workflow oversight; a success can
highlight a specific operation's correct shape. Follow the evidence.

**Modality-persistence corollary (applies during step 7 and read-back):** When
evidence shows the executor's planning step locked the wrong output category
because a rule consulted prompt keywords instead of evaluator-visible evidence
in the artifact contents, strengthen the workflow section covering output
classification. The strengthened rule consults the artifact contents first;
prompt keywords are secondary at most. Once classified, persist: if later prompt
language references a different category, treat it as input metadata, not a
directive to rewrite the artifact.

# §5 — Final read-back (light, not a gate)

After all patches, read back `SKILL.md` + `references/*.md`. Catch common
drift patterns and fix in place. This is an attention list. Items 1, 7, and 8 are hard structural caps — bring them back into range every iteration when violated. For items 2–6, judgment decides the form of the fix.

1. L1 description over 50 words or clause-stacked.
2. L2 section contains content that applies to only one task or one specific
   configuration — lift the specifics to L3.
3. L2 section has more than one code block — the second block is likely
   L3-eligible.
4. L2 section has more than one warning (`Do not X because Y`) — collapse or
   lift.
5. Two L2 sections cover the same operation domain — merge.
6. L3 chapter missing a runnable code block, runtime branch, or verification
   step — add or remove.
7. L3 chapter present but no L2 pointer (orphan), or L2 pointer to a missing
   chapter (broken) — fix both ends.
8. Workflow checklist with too many items in one H2 (resulting in unhealthy bloating workflow patterns)
   — split or rewrite in place.

# §6 — Forbidden actions

These encode failure modes that observed runs have actually produced:

1. **No wholesale redraft.** Do not rewrite SKILL.md from scratch. Edit
   specific sections grounded in pattern evidence.
2. **No task-specific values in L2 code.** No exact column letters, row
   numbers, file names, or formula text from this iteration's tasks in L2.
   Specifics belong in L3.
3. **No orphan L3 chapter.** Every new L3 chapter ships with its L2 pointer
   in the same patch.
4. **No broken L2 pointer.** Do not delete an L3 chapter without removing or
   redirecting its L2 pointer first.
5. **No append-only growth of workflow checklists.** When new evidence belongs
   in an existing workflow item, rewrite the item in place; do not add a new 
   bullet.
6. **No append-only growth of Common pitfalls.** When new pitfall evidence shares its underlying
   mechanism with an existing pitfall, rewrite the existing pitfall to name the broader mechanism class; do not append a new bullet. Two pitfalls covering the same mechanism class is a merge signal.
7. **No detection-only verification.** Every verification check in L3
   prescribes the next corrective action on failure.

# §7 — Bootstrap (iter 1)

The same seven writing principles (§4) apply at iter 1 as at iter 10. No
special bootstrap mandates.

At iter 1 the base skill (~40 lines: YAML frontmatter + Quick Start + one
operation section + Common Pitfalls) is your starting point. Existing base
content stays unless the iter-1 evidence justifies change.

- No iter-1 ban on L3. Principle 5 (textbook density) governs.
- No iter-1 cap on operation H2 count. YAGNI + Frequency awareness govern.
- No iter-1 mandate to keep or strip Quick Start; evidence decides.
- `momentum_memory.md` is empty at iter 1. Empty prior record does not mean
  absent coverage — read the base skill before deciding what to patch.

# §8 — Worked example

**Inputs for this iter:**

*Workflow cluster A* — two successful / contrastive entries sharing a thinking
step:
```
W1: signal=success, pattern=classify-before-operate, anchor=classify-input-first
    gap: executor read the input structure before choosing the operation path;
         task succeeded where prior attempts skipped this step and chose wrong path
W2: signal=success, pattern=classify-before-operate, anchor=classify-input-first
    gap: same classify-before-operate step confirmed on a second task variant
```
WORKFLOW-THEMES emits: `classify input structure before choosing operation path:
appeared in W1, W2 | covers: read input structure at planning time to select
the correct branch`.

*Operation cluster B* — one failure entry with recurrence:
```
O1: signal=failure, pattern=operation-X-precondition-check,
    anchor=verify-predicate-P-before-operation-X
    gap: executor applied operation-X without verifying predicate P on full
         input scope; produced incorrect deliverable Y; remedy_log shows two
         prior atomic edits at this anchor that did not resolve recurrence
    proposed_change: lift full branched algorithm to references/topic.md;
                     rewrite L2 section to brief abstract + pointer
```

**Step 1 — Brainstorm for cluster A (workflow).**
Option 1: add a new workflow H2 "Classify input structure before choosing
operation path" with a 4-item procedural checklist.
Option 2: extend an existing planning H2 by adding one checklist item.
Option 3: add a brief prose paragraph in Quick Start.

Frequency awareness: W1+W2 both support this theme; the behavior generalizes
across operation-X variants. Option 1 fits best — a narrow, standalone workflow
H2 is readable, skimmable, and leaves room to grow.

**Step 2 — Patch cluster A.**
Write or extend the workflow H2 "Classify input structure before choosing
operation path":
- Item 1: observe the input's structure (not the task description).
- Item 2: select the operation branch based on that observation.
- Item 3: record the chosen category; treat subsequent prompt language about
  category as metadata, not a directive to change the artifact.

This H2 sits near the top of SKILL.md (before operation H2s).

**Step 3 — Brainstorm for cluster B (operation + L3).**
Option 1: strengthen the existing L2 inline rule ("check predicate P before
operation-X") again — but remedy_log shows two prior atomic edits did not
resolve recurrence; in-place edits are suspect.
Option 2: lift the branched verification algorithm to
`references/topic.md` and replace the L2 section with a brief abstract +
pointer — structural move justified by recurrence ≥ 3.

Option 2 is chosen.

**Step 4 — Patch cluster B.**
L2 operation-X section becomes:
```
## Operation-X

Apply operation-X to produce deliverable Y. Verify predicate P on full input
scope before writing output.

Read references/topic.md when operation-X output must satisfy predicate P.
Skip when the caller guarantees P on the input before invoking operation-X.
```

New L3 chapter `references/topic.md`:
```python
# Verify predicate P before operation-X
# Branch A: input not pre-filtered — check full scope
if not all(predicate_P(item) for item in input_scope):
    failing = [item for item in input_scope if not predicate_P(item)]
    raise ValueError(f"predicate P violated by: {failing}")

# Branch B: input is pre-filtered by caller — skip check
result = apply_operation_x(input_scope)

# Verification: re-read deliverable Y and confirm P on written values
written = read_deliverable_y()
assert all(predicate_P(v) for v in written), "post-write P check failed"
```
Chapter also includes a trigger paragraph and a corrective step: if the
post-write assertion fires, re-run the full-scope check to locate the
violation before any further write.

**Step 5 — Final read-back.**
- Common Pitfalls: add a cross-cutting item for the predicate-P pattern if the
  Common Pitfalls section doesn't already mention scope-check failures.
- Confirm no orphan L3: the new `references/topic.md` has its L2 pointer
  in the operation-X section above.
- Confirm workflow H2 around 10 items: the new H2 has 3 items — within limit.

**Output:** 2 `write_file` calls — `SKILL.md` (workflow H2 added, operation-X
section rewritten) and `references/topic.md` (new L3 chapter).
