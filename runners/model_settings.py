    ``temperature`` is forwarded into ``ModelSettings.temperature``. For
    Responses-API reasoning models (gpt-5.x, o-series) the SDK passes the
    field through; some proxies map it to per-step sampling, others ignore
    it. For chat-completions providers it directly controls sampling.

    Reasoning effort is intentionally NOT set here. The API default applies
    (for gpt-5.4 that means no reasoning, i.e. "none"). To re-enable, add
    `kwargs["model_settings"] = ModelSettings(reasoning={"effort": "..."})`
    where effort ∈ {"minimal", "low", "medium", "high"}.

    `include_usage=True`, so chat-completions providers (Foundry kimi/grok,
    Gemini compat) emit a usage chunk on the streaming tail and the global
    ledger in `runners.model_dispatch` can capture it. No-op on the
    responses-API path used by OpenAI gpt-*/o-series.

    Args:
        model: Model identifier string (kept for signature stability).
        openai_client: Optional AsyncOpenAI client for local/custom API endpoints.
